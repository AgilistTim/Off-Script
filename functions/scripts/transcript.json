welcome to another episode of hire a fired and today I'll be working at Pizza Hut for a day my first impression of Pizza Hut would be they stopped really good rings it's always a question in my head that they have so many outlets they sell so quickly it is so affordable is it frozen or not I've done a lot of part-time jobs in the FMV sector which i think would be kind of similar but it's ok let's just roll with it because I don't want to be will aced it hi I'm Reggie I'm the field training manager for pizza hut Singapore my role is to ensure that our team members and our managers are being provided with our training and development the most memorable experience working in Pizza Hut is that you get to interact with different kinds of people every day you make each and every event very meaningful to them especially when celebrating birthdays with our guests hi I'm a senior - yeah my name is Reggie I'm the filtering measure for pizza in the park and I will be our buddy for today nice so what will I be doing today today we will have three things to do one is preparing the dough two is making the pizza and three later groan groans got to deliver the pizza I don't know why sensei

call the dough making area in Pizza Hut we do our dope fresh every morning we don't freeze y'all though no Oviedo our team members will be here as really a seven o'clock just to prepare the dough before we start we need to observe proper hygiene what I'm going to share with you first is our ingredients so what we need is water flour oil the secret ingredient it starts so while your dough is being mixed let me show you how we are out the pan make sure the entire surface of the pan is covered ah alright so now we're going to cut the dough it got one long strip first for personnel we need 125 so you just put on the weighing scale oh nice one to six why so hard to have one to fight like one seven four five six seven maybe we start with anything first but it's already here can you do one like you know my normal speed their cage my trapeze ah-ha what when you see customers is able to finish your pizza it really gives you a different satisfaction yeah I'm pretty sure that all my customers will finish because if they don't I will do this why eat it the next thing that we are going to do is hang our dough you're going to press the door yeah wet side facing me slide it down and then it comes out oh wow flat and then stretch then you put it on your head just turn it oh yeah don't forget the tongue oh yeah [Music] okay now if here our whole slogan transfer everybody calm down a few minutes later okay once the dough is ready you're now going to put on topping in served our guests okay we're next station will be our make station this is where we prepare all our pizzas okay that is ready to be served to our guests now I'm going to show you how to prepare a stop press pizza so you stopped it yourself you cool we're going to stretch the dough stuff it with cheese brush with water then she'll make sure the size of your pizza is correct perforate your dough so okay so now they are making four pizzas at the same time because they're orders coming in already they make sure that every pizza is filled with a lot of ingredients I'm in line with it I'm gonna make sure my pizza right you cannot even see the crust welcome back so now we're start with the topic yeah well first we start with Peter some pizza sauce of course you put it in your dough in a circular motion you're doing the pizza the secret is over it with love okay Freddy pull over it's like so pretty like

goes over overboard you know the base of your pizza also see the ceiling pot of your cheese is already open your chicken ham and pineapple I think it's pretty good we have the same recipe we have the same resources but it's the way that you do it you know and the difference is so apparent everything about how things are just look nice a lot now I want you to do your own pizza you guys not now of course it whenever you're ready let's just hit the make time out [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] looking at your pizza it looks really appealing so now I'm gonna try a seafood concept first yes

chicken higher as the normal well did you confess I'm the amazing drum consumers have this is nice too but if I need to choose the prawns actually the fraud okay so it's lunchtime now and what better

there is one component I never thought was important and there is Jaime I'm someone with rubber band time so I know you're a five minutes or actually it's 25 minutes and there's a huge no-no in this industry and there's a reason why I'm so amazed that they can keep their service level so high and consistent I can safely say that this is the only episode I'm very confident of getting hired I have a gut feeling that I will ace it Thank You Reggie it has been a long day today I was able to witness and indulge in as I had fun loving culture the secret to be in this industry is to really love what you're doing that is why from the very beginning for tests today I've always dressed with you the word love and that's why today it doesn't feel like work to me this I'm just here for five loops maybe should have said that before I asked you the important question and that is would you hire or fire me three two one hi because you're hired I'm very much ready I have a contract of service so if you
