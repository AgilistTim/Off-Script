## Validation Coverage

### ✅ Tool Calling Parity
- **analyze_conversation_for_careers**: Identical execution in both modes
- **update_person_profile**: Same parameter handling and state updates
- **generate_career_recommendations**: Consistent recommendation generation
- **trigger_instant_insights**: Matching instant analysis functionality

### ✅ State Management Synchronization  
- **Guest Session Service**: Shared conversation and profile persistence
- **Tree Progress Service**: Identical progress tracking and visualization updates
- **Conversation Flow Manager**: Same tool enablement logic and conversation flow
- **Context Store Integration**: Both modes write to same context keys

### ✅ UI Feedback Consistency
- **Progress Indicators**: `setIsAnalyzing`, `setProgressUpdate` triggered identically
- **Career Cards Display**: `setCareerCards` produces same visual results
- **Profile Insights**: `setDiscoveredInsights` shows identical notifications
- **Visual Timing**: Same loading states, animations, and transitions

### ✅ Enhanced Text Client Integration
- **OpenAI RunTools**: Proper integration with function calling
- **Client Tools Execution**: Successfully executes shared clientTools when OpenAI suggests tool calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages
- **Event Management**: Proper handling of content, function calls, and errors

### ✅ Feature Specification Compliance
- **Single Transport Channel**: No mode switching - users maintain chosen channel throughout session
- **Tool Schema Parity**: Both modes use identical tool definitions and policies
- **Context Store**: Same context keys and atomic updates for both modes
- **Error Handling Policy**: Consistent graceful degradation and retry mechanisms

## Implementation Verification

### Voice Mode Flow ✅
1. ElevenLabs agent suggests tool call
2. `useConversation` hook executes `clientTools[toolName](params)`
3. Client tool updates UI state and triggers progress tracking
4. Results stored in shared Conversation Context Store
5. UI components re-render with new state

### Text Mode Flow ✅  
1. OpenAI suggests tool call via `runTools`
2. Enhanced text client receives `functionCall` event
3. **✅ NEW**: Client executes `this.clientTools[functionCall.name](args)`
4. **✅ NEW**: Same client tool updates UI state (identical to voice mode)
5. **✅ NEW**: Results stored in same Conversation Context Store
6. **✅ NEW**: UI components re-render with identical state updates

## Testing Infrastructure

### Mock Strategy
- **Service Mocking**: Complete mocking of external services (Firebase, OpenAI, ElevenLabs)
- **State Isolation**: Each test runs with fresh state to ensure independence
- **Error Simulation**: Comprehensive error scenario testing
- **Interface Validation**: Function signature and parameter validation

### Test Organization
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component and service testing
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-service interaction validation  
- **End-to-End Scenarios**: Complete user journey simulation
- **Validation Scripts**: Interactive testing and reporting tools

## Success Metrics
