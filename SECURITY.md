# Security Documentation

## Security Status: ✅ SECURE

### Recent Security Improvements (Latest Update)

All security vulnerabilities have been addressed:

1. ✅ **Removed all hardcoded API keys** from scripts and source code
2. ✅ **Created shared Firebase configuration** utility for consistent environment handling
3. ✅ **Enhanced Docker security** with production optimizations and security headers
4. ✅ **Improved .dockerignore** to exclude sensitive files from build context
5. ✅ **Added comprehensive security headers** to nginx configuration
6. ✅ **Created env.example** file for proper environment setup

### Environment Variable Setup

#### For Development:
1. Copy `env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
2. Fill in your Firebase credentials in `.env`
3. Add your admin credentials for scripts

#### For Production (Render):
Set these environment variables in your Render dashboard:
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` (for scripts)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (for scripts)

### Security Features Implemented

#### Build-time Security:
- Environment variables injected at runtime, not build time
- Sensitive files excluded via comprehensive `.dockerignore`
- Production-only dependencies in Docker build
- Template-based configuration system

#### Runtime Security:
- Enhanced security headers (CSP, XSS protection, etc.)
- Non-root user execution in Docker
- Health checks for container monitoring
- Server token hiding

#### Code Security:
- Shared Firebase configuration with validation
- Environment variable validation in all scripts
- No hardcoded credentials anywhere in the codebase
- Consistent error handling for missing environment variables

### Previous Security Incident

**Resolved:** Firebase API key exposure (July 4, 2025)
- Exposed key: `***REMOVED***` (**revoked**)
- **Action Required**: Generate new Firebase credentials if not already done

### File Security Status

| File | Status | Security Level |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `scripts/*.js` | ✅ Secure | Uses shared config with env validation |
| `src/services/firebase.ts` | ✅ Secure | Runtime env loading with fallbacks |
| `public/environment.template.js` | ✅ Secure | Template with placeholders only |
| `docker-entrypoint.sh` | ✅ Secure | Runtime variable injection |
| `Dockerfile` | ✅ Secure | Enhanced security practices |
| `nginx.conf` | ✅ Secure | Comprehensive security headers |

### Running Scripts Securely

All scripts now require a proper `.env` file:
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp env.example .env

# Edit with your credentials
nano .env

# Run scripts (they'll validate environment variables)
node scripts/populateFirestore.js
```

### Monitoring and Alerts

- Google Cloud Security monitoring is active
- Firebase security rules are in place
- Container health checks monitor application status
