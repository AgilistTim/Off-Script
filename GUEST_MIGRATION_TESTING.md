## 🧪 Manual Testing Checklist

### 1. Guest Session Creation & Data Capture

#### Test: Basic Guest Session
1. **Open**: http://localhost:5173 (without logging in)
2. **Navigate to**: Conversation/AI Chat
3. **Verify**: Browser console shows "✅ Guest session initialized: guest_[timestamp]_[random]"
4. **Check**: localStorage has `guest-session-storage` entry

#### Test: Career Cards Generation
1. **Start conversation** with AI about career interests
2. **Generate career cards** through conversation
3. **Verify**: 
   - Career cards appear in UI
   - Console shows "💾 Saved career cards to guest session"
   - localStorage `guest-session-storage` contains career cards
4. **Check**: Guest data preview appears if you visit /register

#### Test: Person Profile Creation
1. **Continue conversation** to build personal profile
2. **Verify**:
   - Person profile appears in UI
   - Console shows "💾 Saved new person profile to guest session"
   - Profile data in localStorage

#### Test: Conversation History
1. **Have extended conversation** (4+ exchanges)
2. **Verify**:
   - Each message logged with "💾 Saved message to guest session"
   - Messages stored in localStorage
   - Guest session marked as having significant data

### 2. Registration Flow with Migration

#### Test: New User Registration with Guest Data
1. **Generate guest data** (career cards + conversation)
2. **Navigate to**: /register
3. **Verify**: Guest Data Preview component appears
4. **Fill registration form** and submit
5. **Check**:
   - Console shows migration start: "🔄 Starting guest data migration..."
   - Console shows completion: "✅ Guest data migration completed"
   - localStorage cleared of guest session
   - User redirected to dashboard

#### Test: Registration without Guest Data
1. **Clear localStorage** (or open incognito tab)
2. **Navigate to**: /register
3. **Verify**: No Guest Data Preview shown
4. **Register normally**
5. **Check**: Standard registration flow works

### 3. Login Flow with Migration

#### Test: Existing User Login with Guest Data
1. **Generate guest data** in one browser tab
2. **Login with existing account**
3. **Verify**: Confirmation prompt appears asking to merge data
4. **Accept merge**
5. **Check**:
   - Migration completes successfully
   - Guest session cleared
   - User data updated

#### Test: Decline Migration
1. **Generate guest data**
2. **Login with existing account**
3. **Decline merge** in confirmation prompt
4. **Check**:
   - Guest session cleared
   - No migration performed
   - Normal login flow

### 4. Data Persistence Verification

#### Test: Firebase Data Structure
After successful migration, verify in Firebase Console:

**Collections Created/Updated:**
- `careerExplorations`: Contains guest career cards
- `chatThreads`: Contains guest conversation
- `userPreferences`: Contains video progress + migration metadata
- `users`: Updated with person profile data
- `userMigrations`: Migration tracking record

#### Test: Data Integrity
1. **Before migration**: Note guest session data
2. **After migration**: Verify all data transferred correctly
3. **Check**: Migration record in `userMigrations` collection

### 5. Error Handling & Edge Cases

#### Test: Network Failures
1. **Generate guest data**
2. **Disconnect internet during registration**
3. **Verify**: Registration still completes (migration fails gracefully)

#### Test: Large Guest Sessions
1. **Generate 10+ career cards**
2. **Have 20+ conversation exchanges**
3. **Add multiple profile interests/goals**
4. **Verify**: Migration handles large datasets

#### Test: Concurrent Sessions
1. **Open multiple tabs with guest sessions**
2. **Generate different data in each**
3. **Register from one tab**
4. **Verify**: Only active session migrates

### 6. Performance & Storage

#### Test: localStorage Limits
1. **Generate significant guest data**
2. **Verify**: localStorage stays under reasonable limits
3. **Check**: Data partitioning excludes analysis results

#### Test: Migration Speed
1. **Time migration process** with substantial data
2. **Verify**: Migration completes in <3 seconds
3. **Check**: No blocking of UI during migration

## 🐛 Known Warnings (Non-Critical)

- **CSS Syntax Warning**: Unterminated string token (cosmetic)
- **Bundle Size**: Large chunks in build (performance optimization opportunity)
- **Firebase Import**: Dynamic/static import mix (expected)

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

### ✅ Safe to Deploy
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing users unaffected
- **Error Isolation**: Auth flows continue if migration fails
- **Data Validation**: Only meaningful data migrated
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Performance**: Optimized with parallel processing

### 🔍 Monitoring Points
After deployment, monitor:
1. **Migration success rate**: Check `userMigrations` collection
2. **Error logs**: Look for migration failures
3. **Performance**: Monitor auth flow speed
4. **User adoption**: Track guest-to-registered conversion

### 📊 Analytics to Track
- Guest session creation rate
- Career cards generated by guests
- Registration conversion with/without guest data
- Migration success/failure rates
- User engagement post-migration
