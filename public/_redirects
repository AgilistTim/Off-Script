# Redirect all routes to index.html for client-side routing (React Router)
# This allows single-page applications to handle routing on the client side

# Static assets (JS, CSS, images) should be served directly
/assets/*  /assets/:splat  200

# API routes (if any) should be handled by server
/api/*  /api/:splat  200

# All other routes should serve index.html to enable React Router
/*  /index.html  200
